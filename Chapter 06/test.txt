#Why you should use Ruby.

Ruby is an open source, powerful programming language. It's a scripting language, 
much like Perl or Python. However, it's surprisingly elegant; complex techniques
can be implemented in just a few lines of code. It's also harmonious, in that
things—even complex things—work the way you might expect them to, even when 
used in surprising ways.

For example, Ruby handles iterators in an interesting way. It defines a simple yet 
powerful way to deal with arbitrary blocks of code. The follow code prints out 1 through 10:

    1.upto(10){ |x|
      print x
    }
